Organic Materials at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz Austria. He earned his
master and PhD in technical chemistry at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in the
field of polymer science. In 1995 he started his career at Borealis, a major company
in the field of Polyolefins, in the central R&D department. After various positions in
the global R&D organization of Borealis he moved back to academia in 2010
accepting the offer by the Johannes Kepler University. In his actual research Prof.
Paulik is focusing on polymerization and structure property relations of Polyolefins
and special polymers, e.g. melamine based materials and antimicrobial polymers, 3D
printing of polymers and high-pressure biotechnology. He is also active in the field of
polymer additives and bio based resources. </p>
