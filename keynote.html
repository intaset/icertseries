  <p class="body"><b>Prab Bandaru</b> is a professor in UCSD’s Mechanical Engineering department, and is also affiliated with the Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Nanoengineering departments. After receiving his Ph.D. from UC, Berkeley, he worked in Applied Materials on non-volatile random access memories and was a postdoctoral fellow in the Electrical Engineering and Physics departments at UCLA on low temperature physics as related to quantum information processing.</p>
  <p class="body">Prab Bandaru and his research group are mainly interested in analytical and experimental materials physics and chemistry and related applications, broadly looking at the electrical, thermal, electrochemical, photonic, and mechanical properties of materials at the nano-meso- , and macro-levels. Related research accomplishments range from synthesis of new magneto-optic materials, establishing the maximum efficiency for thermoelectrics, measurement of the electrical conduction at the single molecule level, use of helical and Y-shaped carbon nanostructures for inductors and nanoelectronics, seminal <i>non-contact</i> optical measurements of thin film thermal conductivity, sub 1 nanometer pore diagnostics in single layer graphene, <i>etc</i>. Professor Bandaru has been recognized through awards such as the Flint Seminar lectureship at Yale University, and from the National Science Foundation, and the Scientific American Top 50.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Thermal Metamaterials Harnessing, Directing, and Dissipating Heat through Structural Design</p>
