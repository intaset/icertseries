  <p class="body">Professor Chuxia Lin holds the Chair in Environmental Science at the School of Environment and Life Science, University of Salford. He obtained his PhD from The University of New South Wales (Australia) and worked as an academic at a few Australian and Chinese universities, and also as an environmental consultant with a global consulting firm before moving to UK. Professor Lin has a broad range of research interests in environmental sciences with a particular focus on environmental issues related to acid sulfate weathering in mine areas (acid mine drainage) and coastal lowlands (acid sulfate soils). Other research interests include chemical behaviour of heavy metals and pesticides in water-soil-plant systems, characterization and treatment of industrial wastes, ecotoxicology, soil carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, and payment for environmental services (PES). He also serves as an Associate Editor for Journal of Environmental Management (Elsevier).</p>
